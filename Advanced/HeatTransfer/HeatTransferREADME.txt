Heat Transfer (part b)

The program is run with an argument!!!

"HeatTransfer.py HeatTransferData.txt"

(I figured this would be best, rather than calling it within the program so
 it's more widely applicable)

It returns an image with the super imposed graph (saved here as HeatTransfer.eps)
and the following is displayed at the standard output:




Exponential a*exp(-bt)+c

a =22.9384198725
b =0.00320307529944
c =67.9664436569

time constant(1/b) = 312.199966131
