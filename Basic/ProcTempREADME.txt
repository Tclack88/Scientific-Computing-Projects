Processor Temperature part a

Run the program using:

ProcTempA.py
(See that file for the comments and logic behind my process)

My output upon running it:

The current processor temperature is:  49.926 degrees Celcius
The current processor temperature is:  49.926 degrees Celcius
The current processor temperature is:  49.388 degrees Celcius
The current processor temperature is:  49.926 degrees Celcius
The current processor temperature is:  49.388 degrees Celcius
The current processor temperature is:  48.85 degrees Celcius
The current processor temperature is:  48.85 degrees Celcius
The current processor temperature is:  49.926 degrees Celcius

Then I forced stopped it




Processor Temperature part b

I ran ProcTempB.py

then I ran ProcTempA.py

Here are the first few outputs from the first script running:
The current processor temperature is:  49.926 degrees Celcius
The current processor temperature is:  49.388 degrees Celcius
The current processor temperature is:  49.388 degrees Celcius
The current processor temperature is:  49.388 degrees Celcius
The current processor temperature is:  49.926 degrees Celcius
The current processor temperature is:  49.388 degrees Celcius
     # This is where I ran the second script
The current processor temperature is:  52.078 degrees Celcius
The current processor temperature is:  54.23 degrees Celcius
The current processor temperature is:  55.306 degrees Celcius
The current processor temperature is:  55.844 degrees Celcius
The current processor temperature is:  56.92 degrees Celcius
The current processor temperature is:  56.92 degrees Celcius
The current processor temperature is:  57.996 degrees Celcius
The current processor temperature is:  59.072 degrees Celcius
The current processor temperature is:  59.072 degrees Celcius
The current processor temperature is:  60.148 degrees Celcius
The current processor temperature is:  60.686 degrees Celcius
The current processor temperature is:  61.224 degrees Celcius
The current processor temperature is:  62.3 degrees Celcius


Evidently processor temperature rose pretty quickly which makes sense because
it's running a process very quickly. Terminating it dropped temperature again:
Here's the next bunch of readings:

The current processor temperature is:  58.534 degrees Celcius
The current processor temperature is:  56.92 degrees Celcius
The current processor temperature is:  54.768 degrees Celcius
The current processor temperature is:  54.23 degrees Celcius
The current processor temperature is:  54.23 degrees Celcius
The current processor temperature is:  54.23 degrees Celcius
The current processor temperature is:  53.692 degrees Celcius
The current processor temperature is:  53.154 degrees Celcius
